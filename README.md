This repository contains code related to the [NEH-funded planning grant](https://rrchnm.org/news/rrchnm-receives-grant-in-collaboration-with-fairfax-citys-office-of-historic-resources-at-historic-blenheim-and-brandy-station-foundation-for-digitization-of-civil-war-graffiti/) for a collaborative project with the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM), Historic Blenheim and the Civil War Interpretive Center (Fairfax City, VA), and the Brandy Station Foundation (Brandy Station, VA).

## Setup 

To create your Django environment, navigate to the root (cloned) directory and do the following: 

```sh
% cd graffitihouse
% python3 -m venv .venv
% source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) % python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you're done doing active work on Django, don't forget to deactivate your virtual environment. 

```sh
% deactivate
```
